Petit was developed to quickly analyze syslog and Apache log files in large environments. It can also be used for word discovery within log data. It is a general purpose tool that can do hashing, word counts, and command line graphing of Apache and syslog files. It is designed to be a standard Unix tool that can be employed with pipes or by opening files. Petit works by sifting data with standard patterns and allows for custom filters and fingerprints. This leaves the analyst with data that is both varied and interesting.
